“Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production”.

*Engineering discipline*
Using appropriate theories and methods to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints.
*All aspects of software production*
Not just technical process of development. Also project management and the development of tools, methods etc. to support software production
###The seminal definition:
[Software engineering is] the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.

###The IEEE definition:
*Software Engineering:* The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.

Software engineers should adopt a systematic and organised approach to their work and use appropriate tools and techniques depending on the problem to be solved, the development constraints and the resources available.
