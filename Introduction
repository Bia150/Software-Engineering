#Software: “Computer programs and associated documentation such as requirements, design models and user manuals”.
-Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market
##Program: The program or code itself is definitely included in the software. 
##Data: The data on which the program operates is also considered as part of the software. 
##Documentation: Another very important thing that most of us forget is documentation. All the documents related to the software are also considered as part of the software.  
So the software is not just the code written in Cobol, Java, Fortran or C++. It also includes the data and all the documentation related to the program.
